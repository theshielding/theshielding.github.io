      <description>In January 2020 I read in a newspaper about the corona virus in China and was immediately alert.1 I started reading up on it. The first reports I came across from China were confusing and disturbing. Within a few days, my alertness grew into worry and real stress. I sensed that this was going to disrupt everything soon, unless we took action. I tried to discuss it with others, but almost everyone brushed it off.</description>

      <description>Four years ago I had a conversation with a colleague about ‘the pandemic that was going to happen soon’.1 They worked in veterinary science and studied avian influenza. Back then, the scientific community seemed convinced that a ‘flu would be the culprit of the next worldwide outbreak. The damage would likely be considerable, my colleague told me. A death rate of 2% would end society as we know it, I was told, but even a less severe virus would be enough for a transformative moment.</description>

      <description>I retired just before the pandemic started.1 That had been quite a turning point for me. I had worked in education until I turned 66. All my life I have been in front of the classroom and was I able to help children and my colleagues. I have always had the feeling that I was really doing something for society. And I would have wanted to continue working, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed.</description>

      <description>We had recently moved to Tasmania from New South Wales, and had built a house in Southern Tasmania when the pandemic began.1 Frank, my husband, works remotely from his office, which is based in Sydney. We used to return to Sydney every six months or so, so that he could go into the office and we could visit our friends. Our daughter had started kindergarten at school, and my son was starting to be old enough to take part in activities such as kindergym.</description>

      <title>A principled, completely rational and moral decision</title>

      <description>The initial decision to shield for me came based on the reports that we were getting from China (mostly through Twitter and personal contacts at this point) about people experiencing severe pneumonia, breathing difficulties and deaths.1 Li Wenliang, the doctor who had initially rang the alarm over a new SARS-like disease, had also sadly died at this point.
I realized that this was a new, unknown virus. I also realized that we had no clue about the sort and extent of health damage that this might cause.</description>
