      <description>About #  The Shielding is run by a small group of people with one thing in common: all of us have been shielding since early on in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
We started The Shielding in March 2022 out of a sense of bafflement and urgency.
Bafflement, because it seemed that the outside world had fallen largely into pandemic denialism. Even though in many regions, infections numbers are still intolerably high.</description>
